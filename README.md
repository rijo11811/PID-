Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Introduction:
The project aims to create a PID controller for a car which should keep it centered on the calculated trajectory. The PID controller is tested on car running in an udacity simulator. 

## Ruberic points discussion:

# code should compile:
the code compiles without any errors.

# Implementation:
The PID controller is designed using the techniques discussed in the nanodegree program PID section.

# Discussion:

P or proportional component of PID controller is the primary error correction component. It creates correction for the car and drives it in the opposite direction of CTE. It results into oscillatioons.

D or differential component of PID controller minimises oscillations created by the proportional P corrections. Finding the correct value for differential error coefficient is central to a controlled drive around the track. I used it to reduce the oscillations in the car's motion.

I or Integral component of the controller helps to tackle the steady state error which is central to increasing the overall accuracy of the controller. In this project, I component helps the car to stay centered to the lane during most part of the drive.

# Choosing the hyperparameters:
# P
I used a manual tuning approach in this PID controller project. First step was to increase the P coefficient to a point where it induces oscillations in the motion of the car, while keeping other coefficients as 0. This value turned out to be 0.05.

# D
In order to dampen the oscillations, I slowly increased the differential error coefficient to a point where it countered oscillations generated by the proportal corrections. This value turned out to be 1.15.

# I
The performance of the PID controller at this stage with Kp = 0.05, Kd = 1.15 and Ki= 0 was decent with car occasionally crossing the yellow marker and possible drive over the road boundary during turns. This issue was resolved by tuning the I coefficient of the PID controller.

In case of scenario where the target value is constant, the Integral error considers all the past errors, however in our case, where the target value is constantly changing, keeping track of all the past errors does not make sense. Therefore , I decided to use only the past 10 erros for calculating the integral error. This was achieved by using a vector which can only store 10 elements at a time and deletes the oldest error if the limit is exceeded. By tuning the Ki, I reached at a value of 0.01, which helped keep the car center during most of the drive.

Thus the final values are: Kp = 0.05, Ki = 0.01 ,Kd = 1.15.

I also tried implementing the SCD approach to coefficient tuning discussed in the paper below, however, found the manual tuning approach to be more effective.
